# CSSTB Project Documentation

## Overview

The CSSTB (Colorsound Supa Tonebender) is a Big Muff Pi variant that was sold under the "Colorsound" brand and distributed by the UK company in the 1970s.

## Circuit Description

The main difference between a standard Big Muff and a Supa Tonebender is:
- Removal of the first two clipping diodes
- Removal of a coupling capacitor

This results in:
- Louder output
- Thick distortion
- More low-end response
- Less "fuzzy" character, more distortion-oriented

## PCB Specifications

- **Dimensions**: 81mm x 43mm
- **Recommended Enclosure**: 1590BB
- **Component Layout**: Loose layout for flexibility with part selection
- **Special Features**: 1/4" center hole for PCB standoffs

## Build Notes
